    <h2>Why do I need Estimated Delivery Dates?</h2>
                        <p>
                       You’ve built great landing pages, garnered a strong social media presence and worked hard at optimizing SEO – but something is preventing your ecommerce conversion rate: Shipping anxiety. It’s an especially magnified issue when dealing with new brands who are unfamiliar to the online shopper.
                       </p>
                       <p>
When it comes to shipping times, the customer needs a lot of information before they buy. Upfront and honest communication will alleviate their anxiety while also getting ahead of potential calls that can get in the way of your support team.
</p>
<p>
You have to be careful when it comes to how you're presenting the information as customers can feel like they’re being hit with too much. Shipping schedules can often provide a unique value proposition for your company. Whether that's being able to ship on demand or even just helping them make good decisions about what product is right for their needs!
  </p>
  <p>
Business Days can be unclear and customers deserve better experience so giving them a great customer service is essential in conversion rate optimization!

                            <h2>Management of Backorders -  Provide clear updates before and after purchases</h2>
                            <p>
Backorders and low inventory are on the rise, but they often result in increased customer support calls and tickets because customers don't want to wait for their orders
</p>
<p>
 Make sure you don’t miss out on this opportunity to engage with customers. Let them know the delivery lead times for their product before they purchase it and be sure to send automated updates by email or SMS.
</p>
<p>
 With the Estimated Delivery Date Extension, you can set and display estimated shipping dates for specific backordered products, collections, vendors or even the entire store via the WeSupply Platform or by sending updates to the ERP via our API.
</p>
 <h2>How does the Delivery Date Calculator work?</h2>
 <p>
You can finally ditch that static chart and vague estimations for good. Our solution provides an accurate delivery date predictor based on past data, customer location analytics, and more.
</p>
<p>
 The shipping calculator uses historical data, taking into account weekends and holidays, to predict processing time. It then adds transit time upon which courier and shipping options are chosen. We collect the zip code of the customer’s location to ensure that we can estimate their due date according to how long it will take them within a unique delivery area surrounding where they live.
</p>
<p>
 The Estimator can now be found on a variety of pages to ensure that your customers know when they will receive their items.
</p>
<ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Product Page:</strong> Automatically detected customer location
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Cart Page:</strong> When the customer gets shipping estimates
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Checkout Page:</strong> When the customer selects their shipping method
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><img src="https://wesupplylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-min-1.png"></p>
                            <h2>Flexible Shipping Rules</h2>
 <p>
Flexible shipping rates are a must for any company that provides a wide array of products or simply houses them in distribution centers. Custom made items like laptops take longer to process than generic goods such as t-shirts and overseas shipments can be slower due to the distance they have traveled compared with those domestically held by your business.
</p>
<p>
WeSupply allows you to choose the scenario that works best for your business, all the way from broad to specific. Drive revenue growth and increase trust by choosing:
</p>
<ul>
                            <li>
                                A flat delivery estimate rule that applies to all products
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Estimates based on Category
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Individual product-based delivery estimates
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><img src="https://wesupplylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/4-min-1.png"></p>
                             <h2>Weekends, Holidays, and Cut-Off Times pose delivery challenges</h2>
 <p>
Our shipping time calculator is a tool that allows you to simply define all of the non-shipping days. It automatically excludes them from the estimated shipping date, which means customers are more accurately informed about when they can expect their packages. We also allow you an option for adding a delivery range safety net in peak seasons; these will help your customer understand realistic expectations!
